# Random Clusters Generator

Generate datasets with defined clusters using a normal distribution. This specialized tool allows you to customize data creation, specifying the number of significant columns forming the clusters. Additionally, it provides the option to include dummy columns, adding variability and noise to your datasets.

## Key Features:

- **Defined Clusters:** Create datasets with clearly defined clusters, ideal for applying clustering algorithms.
- **Normal Distribution:** Utilize a normal distribution to generate data, providing realism and coherence in your datasets.
- **Significant Columns Configuration:** Customize the number of columns forming clusters, allowing you to adjust the complexity of your datasets.
- **Optional Dummy Columns:** Add dummy columns to introduce variability and noise in the data, providing a more realistic approach to real-world scenarios.


## Project Status

ðŸš€ **In Development | Production Ready**

This project is in constant evolution to enhance and expand its functionalities. We welcome any community contributions to make it even more robust.
While the current version is ready for deployment in production environments, we are committed to continuous improvement and optimization of the code. Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the project. Refer to the Contribution section for more details on how to get involved in development.
Your feedback and suggestions are valuable to us. Together, we can make this project even better!

# Project Structure

This project consists of three main files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`main_generator.py`**: This file is responsible for generating datasets based on the parameters provided. It allows users to create customized datasets with defined clusters using a normal distribution. Users can specify the number of significant columns forming the clusters and choose to include additional dummy columns for added variability.
- **`main_generator_parameters.py`**: This file generates datasets based on parameters specified in a CSV file. Users can provide a CSV file containing configuration details, and the script will use this information to create datasets accordingly.
- **`add_dummy_columns.py`**: The purpose of this file is to add dummy columns to an existing CSV file. It takes a CSV file as input and appends additional columns with dummy data, introducing variability and noise to the dataset.
